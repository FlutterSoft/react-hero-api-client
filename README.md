# React Overwatch Hero Search
Node.JS/Express CRUD API connected - Search for a hero and receive the hero details back from the API I created and hosted.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, API Fetch

Originally developed without React, I decided to see how simple it would be to use React instead. Data is received as JSON via a Node.JS/Express API

## Optimizations

I'm unsure but it may be better to load the hero json object as a whole once on load then run the functions client side rather than recontacting the api every time a search is made. Since the data does not change this shouldn't affect anything negatively.

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to incorporate API functionality into React based development.
